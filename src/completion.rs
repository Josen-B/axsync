//! completion 
//! If you have one or more threads that must wait for some kernel activity
//! to have reached a point or a specific state, completions can provide a
//! race-free solution to this problem. Semantically they are somewhat like a
//! pthread_barrier() and have similar use-cases.
//!
//! Completions are a code synchronization mechanism which is preferable to any
//! misuse of locks/semaphores and busy-loops. Any time you think of using
//! yield() or some quirky msleep(1) loop to allow something else to proceed,
//! you probably want to look into using one of the wait_for_completion*()
//! calls and complete() instead.
//!
//! Completions are built on top of the waitqueue and wakeup infrastructure of 
//! scheduler(axtask). The event the threads on the waitqueue are waiting for
//! is reduced to a simple flag in 'struct completion', appropriately called "done".
//!
